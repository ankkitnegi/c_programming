C is the best language to learn as a beginner.
We recommend c to every beginner as it is fundamental language of all the hardcore programming language.
The bascis are of course most important of all, so if you are good ind c basics you are in way of becoming a good programmmer.
As a C enthusiast I like to work with C and C++ mostly.
